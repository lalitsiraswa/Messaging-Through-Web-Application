so today i have add the functionality of workspace which includes

1. Creating new workspace
   after creating workspace role of the one who created workspace will change from [user -> owner_worskapceName#randomId] and along with it one general channel is created with name group#randomID and worksapce name will be worksapce#erandomID

2. Adding handler to workspace
   Now, handler is like sub-admin of the workspace who can see all the group channels and so does the owner

3. Adding Employee to workspace
   Adding an employee to workspace will give him access to communicate people of that worksapce in general chat

4. reason behind appending uniqueID worspaceName is
   for ex -> if one workspace have muliple branches accross the world because of their same name their is chances of collison, to overcome it a unique shortId is appended at the end of workspaceName
